# deepmind_athomewithai
During the pandemic DeepMind has been publishing a series of short posts on LinkedIn (tagged as #AtHomeWithAI) with a collection of resources that some of their staff find interesting. In a time where there is a lot of noise surrounding Machine Learning finding really good resources to learn from is not trivial. This collection ranges from RL, DL to Operational Research, Bias in ML, Probabilistic Models, etc. I don't think I have ever seen a more curated and pure useful collection of resources ever. Unsurprisingly, DeepMind people know what they are talking about. I have been collecting their posts and since the series ended a few days ago I thought I should share them here in case somebody finds them useful. I have highlighted the researcher or engineer that recommends each group of resources in case you want to follow them on twitter or whatever. I hope you find them useful.
