# deepmind_athomewithai

## Introduction

During the pandemic DeepMind has been publishing a series of short posts on LinkedIn (tagged as #AtHomeWithAI) with a collection of resources that some of their staff find interesting. In a time where there is a lot of noise surrounding Machine Learning finding really good resources to learn from is not trivial.

This collection ranges from RL, DL to Operational Research, Bias in ML, Probabilistic Models, etc. I don't think I have ever seen a more curated and pure useful collection of resources ever. Unsurprisingly, DeepMind people know what they are talking about. I have been collecting their posts and since the series ended a few days ago I thought I should share them. Here it is.

## Collection

For those interested in expanding their knowledge of AI during this period, we thought it might be helpful to ask our researchers what they consider to be the most impactful and insightful resources available to use #AtHomeWithAI.
